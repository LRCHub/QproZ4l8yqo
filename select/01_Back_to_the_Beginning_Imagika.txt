Back to the beginning to find what's been missing
Years of compromising have given my life no meaning
I question everything faith doesn't come that easy
It seems I'm complete yet I still long for something more
And I can't understand why
No matter how hard I try

The lies, they're haunting me
Why, can't I see?
I can't breathe
They're killing me

Lies, they' re haunting me
Why, can't I see?
I can't breathe
They're killing me

When all ties are broken
Last words spoken
When all seems hopeless why can't we just go?

Back to the beginning to find what's been missing
My world is still spinning can't put my mind at ease
The voice in my head is screaming there's something you're forgetting
It seems I've everything yet I still long for something more
And I can't understand why
No matter how hard I try

The Lies, they're haunting me
Why, can't I see?
I can't breathe
They're killing me

Lies, they're haunting me
Why, can't I see?
I can't breathe
They're killing me

When all ties are broken
Last words spoken
When all seems hopeless why can't we just go?

Now I remember why...
An incomplete feeling, nagging me from inside
I was never one to just let things go
An unresolved conflict that's stood the test of time
An unfinished story never told

All the heartaches
And the mistakes
Are reoccurring
Something' s stirring

A hasty decision, forgiveness is divine
I always knew I needed something more
A familiar fragrance from once upon a time
A slew of memories I'd never wished for

All the heartaches
And the mistakes
Are reoccurring
Something' s stirring

Back to the beginning to find what's been missing
I've been unforgiving my pride is my undoing
I've taken so completely offered hands that were empty
It seems I need nothing yet I still long for something more
And I can't understand why
No matter how hard I try

The Lies, they're haunting me
Why, can't I see?
I can't breathe
They're killing me

Lies, they're haunting me
Why, can't I see?
I can't breathe
They're killing me

When all ties are broken
Last words spoken
When all seems hopeless why can't we just go back?
When all ties are broken
Last words spoken
When all seems hopeless why can't we just go?
Why?
