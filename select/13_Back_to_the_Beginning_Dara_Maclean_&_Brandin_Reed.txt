Lord I remember
The day that You came
In my time of surrender
The moment of grace
Love moved with power
Shook off my shame
Tears that came rushing out
Pouring down like rain

And I was like
Oh la la, here we go
You filled my heart with the Holy Ghost
Oh la la, can You do it once again

Take me back to the beginning
I wanna to go back to the beginning
Can we go back to the beginning
Where I first believed

Take me back to the beginning
I wanna to go back to the beginning
Can we go back to the beginning
Where I first believed

I can't forget it
The day I was changed
When You took all my sorrow
And shouldered my pain
How did you do it?
I can't explain
But I left from that altar floor
With no more chains

And I was like
Oh la la, here we go
You filled my heart with the Holy Ghost
Oh la la, can You do it once again

And I was like
Oh la la, here we go
You filled my heart with the Holy Ghost
Oh la la, can You do it once again
Take me back to the beginning
I wanna to go back to the beginning
Can we go back to the beginning
Where I first believed

Take me back to the beginning
I wanna to go back to the beginning
Can we go back to the beginning
Where I first believed

If you did it before
You can do it again
If you did it before
You can do it, do it again

If you did it before
You can do it again
If you did it before
You can do it, do it again

If you did it before
You can do it again
If you did it before
You can do it, do it again

If you did it before
You can do it again
If you did it before
You can do it, do it again

So do again, do it again, yea
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again, yea
Do it again, do it again

I was like
Oh la la, here we go
You filled my heart with the Holy Ghost
Oh la la, can You do it once again

Take me back to the beginning
I wanna to go back to the beginning
Can we go back to the beginning
Where I first believed

Take me back to the beginning
I wanna to go back to the beginning
Can we go back to the beginning
Where I first believed

Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
