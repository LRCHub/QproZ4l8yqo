And could you take me to the beginning
When I was so much younger
Where make believe could hide me from the world that matters
I don't need these demons inside of my head
And I can stop this screaming
So I can start dreaming again yeah

It seems as if the world today moves a hundred times faster
I can't keep up with these names and dates and uncontrollable factors
So slow the music down
This world is spinning all around
When will we know it's time to fight

At the end of the week
Who are we
Are we finding love
Are we looking up
To the heavens
When will the song inside our hearts
Be enough to sing forever
Listen close
'Cause this could be the sound you're looking for

So look close
It's hard to see the enemy
No one knows
They're blinded by his beauty
He whispers sweet temptation
Desire is the devil's flirtation

At the end of the week
Who are we
Are we finding love
Are we looking up
To the heavens
When will the song inside our hearts
Be enough to sing forever
Listen close
'Cause this could be the sound you're looking for

At the end of the week
Who are we
Are we finding love
To the heavens
When will the song inside our hearts
Be enough to sing forever
Listen close
'Cause this could be the sound you're looking for
